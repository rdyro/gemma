      "A weary, space-worn alien named Zorp stumbled through the bustling marketplace of a newly-formed planet called \"New-Earth-a-lot.\" He was on a mission, a very important one, to find the legendary \"Cosmic Cosmicator,\" a device rumored to be able to create any flavor of cosmic cosmic dust. \n",
      "\n",
      "He'd been traveling for what felt like an eternity, traversing through wormhole-infested nebulae, dodging asteroid asteroids the size of small planets, and even having to endure a particularly awkward intergalactic tea party with a species of sentient, but extremely chatty, mushrooms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after weeks of searching, Zorp found it. The Cosmic Cosmicator, gleaming like a freshly-polished space-rock, sat nestled in a dusty corner of the market.  He approached it cautiously, his three-fingered hand twitching with anticipation. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Greetings, Cosmic Cosmicator,\" Zorp boomed, his voice echoing through the crowded market. \"I have come to you for a favor. I need to create a cosmic cosmic dust that will be the perfect flavor for my new wife, Glargle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cosmic Cosmicator hummed, its light pulsing with a soft, blue glow.  \"A most noble request, Zorp,\" it boomed back, its voice a deep, resonant rumble. \"But be warned, the cosmic cosmic dust is a fickle mistress. It requires a precise touch, a deep understanding of the cosmic cosmic dance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zorp, a bit flustered, scratched his three-fingered head. \"I'm not sure I understand the cosmic cosmic dance,\" he admitted, \"but I'm sure I can find the right flavor for Glargle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cosmic Cosmicator, with a slight whir and a flash of light, projected a holographic holographic image of a cosmic cosmic dance. It was a swirling, chaotic, and utterly mesmerizing display of cosmic energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cosmic cosmic dance,\" the Cosmic Cosmicator explained, \"is a complex and intricate process. It involves the manipulation of cosmic cosmic energy, the creation of cosmic cosmic particles, and the careful blending of cosmic cosmic flavors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zorp, his eyes wide with wonder, watched the holographic image. He had never seen anything like it. It was a cosmic cosmic ballet, a cosmic cosmic symphony, a cosmic cosmic masterpiece. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" the Cosmic Cosmicator continued, \"the cosmic cosmic dust is not just about the dance. It's about the feeling, the emotion, the soul of the cosmic cosmic being.\"\n",

      "Zorp, his mind abuzz with the cosmic cosmic dance, suddenly realized he had a problem. He had no idea what the cosmic cosmic soul of a being was. He had no idea what the cosmic cosmic feeling was. He had no idea what the cosmic cosmic emotion was. \n",
